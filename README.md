# My Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, live at **[www.abknative.fr](https://www.abknative.fr)**.

This project serves as both my online resume and a technical demonstration. It is built from the ground up using **Compose for Web**, showcasing how Kotlin can be used to create modern, static websites.

The entire site is deployed as a static build on **GitHub Pages**, which provides a fast, reliable, and free hosting solution.

### Tech Stack

- **UI Framework**: [Compose for Web](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform)
- **Language**: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- **Hosting**: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (Static Site Hosting)
- **Domain Provider**: [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/)

This setup demonstrates a simple yet powerful CI/CD pipeline where pushing to the `main` branch automatically updates the live site.
